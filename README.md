# Potato Late Blight and Early Blight Detection Model

## Abstract

This document describes the development and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for the automated classification of potato leaves affected by early blight, late blight, and healthy conditions. This model serves as a critical tool for agricultural monitoring and disease management, enabling timely interventions to mitigate crop losses due to these prevalent plant diseases.

## Introduction

Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) are a staple food source globally, but they are vulnerable to various diseases, notably early blight (Alternaria solani) and late blight (Phytophthora infestans). These diseases can severely impact yield and quality, necessitating efficient monitoring and diagnosis methods. This model utilizes deep learning techniques to automate the classification of potato leaf images, providing farmers and agricultural professionals with a reliable decision-support tool.

## Objectives

- To develop a robust machine learning model capable of distinguishing between potato leaves exhibiting early blight, late blight, and healthy conditions.
- To evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and visualizations, including confusion matrices.
- To provide an open-source resource for future research and development in plant disease detection.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

A dataset comprising images of potato leaves was collected from **Kaggle** and categorized into three classes:
1. **Potato__Early_blight**
2. **Potato__Late_blight**
3. **Potato__healthy**

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, ensuring diverse representations of each class.

### Model Architecture

The model employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for image classification. The key components include convolutional layers for feature extraction, max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.

### Training Procedure

The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. The training process involved multiple epochs and batch processing, with validation included to monitor overfitting and model generalization.

## Results

### Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using the validation set, and performance metrics were calculated, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices were generated to visualize classification performance across the three classes.

### Sample Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix illustrating the model's classification performance is available in the repository.

### Class Distribution

The distribution of classes in the validation dataset is summarized in the results section of the repository.

## Discussion

The results demonstrate that the CNN model effectively classifies potato leaves, providing insights into the potential for real-world applications in agricultural practices. The model's performance can be further enhanced through techniques such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and transfer learning.

## Conclusion

This model represents a significant step towards the automation of plant disease detection, providing farmers with a valuable tool for managing crop health. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, improving model accuracy, and integrating the model into mobile applications for field use.
